In Germany’s university admissions, the first stages of the Gale-Shapley algorithm are implemented in real time, allowing for multiple offers per student. We demonstrate that nonexploding early offers are accepted more often than later offers, despite not being more desirable. These results, together with survey evidence and a theoretical model, are consistent with students’ costly discovery of preferences. A novel dynamic multioffer mechanism that batches early offers improves matching efficiency by informing students of offer availability before preference discovery.},

Despite this interest, numerous barriers prevent the public sector from acting as an intelligent and informed customer. This paper seeks to understand how barriers related to processes, competences, procedures and relationships in public procurement influence suppliers׳ ability to innovate and to reap the benefits of innovation. We address this by exploiting a dedicated survey of public sector suppliers in the {UK}, using a probit model to investigate the influence of structural, market and innovation determinants on suppliers׳ perception of these barriers. The main barriers reported by suppliers refer to the lack of interaction with procuring organisations, the use of over-specified tenders as opposed to outcome based specifications, low competences of procurers and a poor management of risk during the procurement process. Such barriers are perceived most strongly by R\&D intensive organisations. Our results also indicate that certain organisations, particularly smaller firms and not-forprofit organisations, encounter greater difficulties with innovation arising from the procurement process, for instance in relation to contract size, lack of useful feedback and communication of opportunities. Government procurement policies are queried in light of the findings.},

An alternative way is to reserve some seats at each school for the minority students, and to require that a reserve seat at a school be assigned to a majority student only if no minority student prefers that school to her assignment. However, fair rules based on either type of affirmative action suffer from a common problem: a stronger affirmative action may not benefit any minority student and hurt some minority students. First, we show that this problem is pervasive. Then, we uncover the root of this problem: for some minority students, treating them as minority students does not benefit them, but possibly hurts other minority students.

	abstract = {Zusammenfassung
Hintergund
Durch die Zunahme der älteren Bevölkerung steigt die Anzahl altersbedingter Erkrankungen und damit der Bedarf an geriatrischen Versorgungsleistungen. In ländlichen Regionen mit geringer Bevölkerungsdichte und wenigen Leistungserbringern besteht die Gefahr einer unzureichenden Versorgung.
Ziel der Studie
Ziel war die Identifikation von Versorgungslücken und präferierierten Verbesserungsansätzen in ländlichen Regionen aus Sicht ansässiger Leistungserbringer und Akteure.
Methodik
1.545 Leistungserbringer und Akteure aus zwei ländlichen Regionen wurden standardisiert zur Versorgungssituation (Bewertung durch Schulnoten) sowie zu Verbesserungsansätzen und Problemen (einfache Häufigkeiten) befragt. Die Antworten der Teilnehmer wurden nach ihrem Dienstsitz nach dem Konzept der Zentralen Orte (Oberzentren und Mittel- und Grundzentren) kategorisiert und ausgewertet.
Ergebnisse
348 Leistungserbringer und Akteure nahmen teil (Response: 22,5\%). Die ambulante und stationäre Versorgungssituation in der Geriatrie wurde im Mittel mit „befriedigend“ bewertet. Lange Wartezeiten auf Facharztbehandlung gefährden die geriatrische Versorgung am häufigsten (71,0\%). Signifikante Unterschiede zwischen den Raumkategorien bestanden in der Bewertung der Abdeckung der geriatrischen Versorgung durch stationäre Einrichtungen (p=0.0018) und der Erreichbarkeit medizinischer Einrichtungen mit öffentlichem Nahverkehr (p={\textless}0.001). Diese wurden in den Oberzentren besser bewertet. Der präferierte Ansatz der Teilnehmer zur Verbesserung der Versorgung war die berufsgruppenübergreifende Vernetzung (62,3\%) der Akteure.
Schlussfolgerung
In den ländlichen Regionen bestehen Versorgungsprobleme in der Geriatrie bei der Erreichbarkeit und durch Wartezeiten insbesondere in den Mittel- und Grundzentren. Lösungsansätzen im Sinne einer regionalen, sektorübergreifenden und interprofessionellen Versorgung wurde mehrheitlich zugestimmt.
Background
Due to a growing elderly population the number of age-related diseases increases and thus the need for geriatric care. In rural areas with low population density and few healthcare providers there is a risk of inadequate care.
Aim of the study
The aim of our investigation was to identify gaps in care and preferred improvement approaches in rural areas from the perspective of local care providers.
Methods
1,545 healthcare providers from two rural regions were surveyed on the care situation (assessment according to the German school grading system), improvement approaches and problems (simple frequencies). The participants’ answers were categorized and analyzed by their work location according to the central-place concept of high-order, middle-order and lower-order (basic) centers.
Results
348 healthcare providers participated (response rate: 22.5 \%). The outpatient and inpatient care situation in geriatrics was rated “satisfactory” on average. Geriatric care is most often jeopardized by long waiting times for specialist treatment (71.0 \%). Significant differences in the rating were found in the coverage of geriatric care by inpatient care (p=0.0018) and the accessibility of medical facilities by public transport (p={\textless}0.001). These were better rated in the higher-order centers. The preferred approach to improve care was intersectoral networking (62.3 \%) among care providers.
Conclusions
In rural areas, supply problems in geriatrics exist, in particular accessibility and waiting times in middle-order and basic centers. Solutions of regional, intersectoral and interprofessional care were approved by a majority of the participants.},

	abstract = {Introduction
In this chapter we propose a method for auctioning many related items. A typical application is a spectrum sale in which different bidders combine licenses in different ways. Some pairs of licenses may be substitutes and others may be complements. Indeed, a given pair of licenses may be substitutes for one bidder but complements for another, and may change between substitutes and complements for a single bidder as the prices of the other licenses vary. Our proposed method combines two auction formats—the clock auction and the proxy auction—to produce a hybrid with the benefits of both.The clock auction is an iterative auction procedure in which the auctioneer announces prices, one for each of the items being sold. The bidders then indicate the quantities of each item desired at the current prices. Prices for items with excess demand then increase, and the bidders again express quantities at the new prices. This process is repeated until there are no items with excess demand.The ascending proxy auction is a particular package bidding procedure with desirable properties (see Ausubel and Milgrom 2002, 2006). The bidders report values to their respective proxy agents. The proxy agents iteratively submit package bids on behalf of the bidders, selecting the best profit opportunity for a bidder given the bidder's inputted values. The auctioneer then selects the provisionally winning bids that maximize revenues. This process continues until the proxy agents have no new bids to submit.The clock-proxy auction is a hybrid auction format that begins with a clock phase and ends with a final proxy round. First, bidders directly submit bids in a clock auction, until there is no excess demand for any item. Then bidders have a single opportunity to input proxy values. The proxy round concludes the auction. All bids are kept live throughout the auction. There are no bid withdrawals. The bids of a particular bidder are mutually exclusive. There is an activity rule throughout the clock phase and between the clock phase and the proxy round.},

The mechanism can accommodate complementarities in providers' preferences, is fast to terminate even in larger cities, is difficult to manipulate in practice, and produces stable allocations. It can be further sped up by introducing two new features. First, allowing for an arbitrary share of facilities who participate in a centralized manner by submitting a rank-order-list over applicants. Second, by breaking ties in applicants' rank-order-lists on a first-come-first-serve basis, which sets incentives for programs to propose faster. We provide and evaluate simulation results.},

We demonstrate that, with hard bounds, there might not exist assignments that satisfy standard fairness and non-wastefulness properties; and only constrained non-wasteful assignments that are fair for same type students can be guaranteed to exist. We introduce the student exchange algorithm that finds a constrained efficient assignment among such assignments. To achieve fair (across all types) and non-wasteful assignments, we propose control constraints to be interpreted as soft bounds–flexible limits that regulate school priorities dynamically. In this setting, (i) the student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm produces an assignment that Pareto dominates all other fair assignments while eliciting true preferences and (ii) the school-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm finds an assignment that minimizes violations of controlled choice constraints among fair assignments.},

Then it shows that the student-applying deferred acceptance mechanism makes truthful revelation of preferences a dominant strategy for every student if each college's preferences satisfy responsiveness over acceptable sets of students that respect its type-specific quotas.

We present direct field evidence of preference misrepresentation under the strategy-proof deferred acceptance in a high-stakes matching environment. We show that applicants to graduate programs in psychology in Israel often report that they prefer to avoid receiving funding, even though the mechanism preserves privacy and funding comes with no strings attached and constitutes a positive signal of ability. Surveys indicate that other kinds of preference misrepresentation are also prevalent. Preference misrepresentation in the field is associated with weaker applicants.

Given finite capacity, public hospitals are strictly less likely to transfer patients than profit-motivated private hospitals at the same level of capacity. We test implications of the model using hospital administrative data from Victoria, Australia, and find empirical support for the cream skimming predictions of the model.},

We examine whether competition led to better outcomes for patients, as measured by death rates after treatment following heart attacks. Using data that until 1999 were not publicly available in any form on hospital level death rates, we find that the relationship between competition and quality of care appears to be negative. Greater competition is associated with higher death rates, controlling for patient mix and other observed characteristics of the hospital and the catchment area for its patients. However, the estimated impact of competition is small.},

Using panel data on 28 countries over the period 1990–2004, we exploit the phased shift from historical budgets to explore aggregate impacts on hospital throughput, national health spending, and mortality from causes amenable to medical care. We use a regression version of difference-in-differences ({DID}) and two variants that relax the {DID} parallel trends assumption. We find that {FFS} and {PBP} both increased national health spending, including private (i.e. out-of-pocket) spending. However, they had different effects on inpatient admissions ({FFS} increased them; {PBP} had no effect), and average length of stay ({FFS} had no effect; {PBP} reduced it). Of the two methods, only {PBP} appears to have had any beneficial effect on “amenable mortality”, but we found significant impacts for only a couple of causes of death, and not in all model specifications.},

	abstract = {Canada's health care system has undergone major changes since 1990. In Saskatchewan, 52 small rural hospitals funded for less than eight beds stopped receiving funding for acute care services in 1993. Most were subsequently converted to primary health care centers. Since then, concerns have been raised about the impact of the changes on rural residents’ access to care, their health status, and the viability of rural communities. To assess the impact of hospital closures on the affected communities, we conducted a multi-faceted, province-wide study. We looked at hospital use patterns, health status, rural residents’ perceptions of the impact of these hospital closures, and how communities responded to the changes. We found the hospital closures did not adversely affect rural residents’ health status or their access to inpatient hospital services. Despite widespread fears that health status would decline, residents in these communities reported that hospital closures did not adversely affect their own health. Although some communities continue to struggle with changes to health care delivery, others appear to have adapted as a result of strong community leadership, the development of widely accepted alternative services, and local support for creating innovative solutions. Good rural health care does not depend on the presence of a very small hospital that cannot, in today's environment, provide genuinely acute care. It requires creative approaches to the provision of primary care, good emergency services, and good communication with the public on the intent and outcomes of change.},

For each of the mortality, readmission, process, and patient experience measures, more than 70\% of hospitals agreed with the statement that “public reporting stimulates quality improvement activity at my institution”; agreement for measures of cost and volume was 65.2\% and 53.3\%, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for the statement that “our hospital is able to influence performance on this measure”; agreement for processes of care and patient experience measures was 96.4\% and 94.2\%, respectively. A total of 89.7\% of hospitals agreed that the hospital’s reputation was influenced by patient experience measures; agreement was 77.4\% for mortality, 69.9\% for readmission, 76.3\% for process measures, 66.1\% for cost measures, and 54.0\% for volume measures. A total of 87.1\% of hospitals reported incorporating performance on publicly reported measures into their hospital’s annual goals, whereas 90.2\% reported regularly reviewing the results with the hospital’s board of trustees and 94.3\% with senior clinical and administrative leaders. When compared with chief executive officers and chief medical officers, respondents who identified themselves as chief quality officers or vice presidents of quality were less likely to agree that public reporting stimulates quality improvement and that measured differences are large enough to differentiate among hospitals. Hospital leaders indicated that the measures reported on the Hospital Compare website exert strong influence over local planning and improvement efforts. However, they expressed concerns about the clinical meaningfulness, unintended consequences, and methods of public reporting.},

We find that a hospital's quality is positively associated with the quality of its rivals for seven out of the sixteen quality measures. There are no statistically significant negative associations. In those cases where there is a significant positive association, an increase in rivals' quality by 10\% increases a hospital's quality by 1.7\% to 2.9\%. The finding suggests that for some quality measures a policy which improves the quality in one hospital will have positive spillover effects on the quality in other hospitals.},

Under price competition, profit constraints reduce quality and cost containment efforts, but lead to lower prices if and only if firms are sufficiently altruistic. Profit constrained firms’ cost containment efforts are below the first-best, while their quality might be too high or too low. If prices are regulated, profit constraints can improve welfare and be a complement or substitute to a higher regulated price, depending on the degree of altruism.},

Exploiting policy-induced variation in hospital distance derived from emergency hospital closures and detailed Swedish mortality data over two decades, results show a drastically decreasing probability of surviving an {AMI} as residential distance from a hospital increases one year after a closure occurred.

This paper investigates the phenomenon of cream skimming in a mixed public-private hospital setting using the novel approach of analysing hospital transfers. We analyse hospital administrative data of patients with ischemic heart disease from the state of Victoria, Australia. The data set contains approximately 1.77 million admission episodes in 309 hospitals, of which 132 are public hospitals, and 177 private hospitals. We ask if patients transferred between public and private hospitals differ systematically in the severity and complexity of their medical conditions; and if so, whether utilisation also differs. We find that patients with higher disease severity are more likely to be transferred from private to public hospitals whereas the opposite is true for patients transferred to private hospitals. We also find that patients transferred from private to public hospitals stayed longer and cost more than private-to-private transfer patients, after controlling for patients' observed health conditions and personal characteristics. Overall, the evidence is suggestive of the presence of cream skimming in the Victorian hospital system, although we cannot conclusively rule out other mechanisms that might influence hospital transfers.},

Whether report cards are good for patients and for society depends on whether their financial and health benefits outweigh their costs in terms of the quantity, quality, and appropriateness of medical treatment that they induce. Using national data on Medicare patients at risk for cardiac surgery, we find that cardiac surgery report cards in New York and Pennsylvania led both to selection behavior by providers and to improved matching of patients with hospitals. On net, this led to higher levels of resource use and to worse health outcomes, particularly for sicker patients.

In 1983, the federal government replaced its previous cost-based reimbursement method with a Prospective Payment System, under which reimbursement depends only on the diagnosis of the patient. Hospitals thus lost the marginal reimbursement they formerly received for providing additional treatments. In addition, the average price each hospital received for patients with different diagnoses changed. This paper relates each of these changes to adverse outcomes, with two conclusions. First, there is a change in the timing of deaths associated with changes in average prices. In hospitals with price declines, a greater share of deaths occur in the hospital or shortly after discharge, but by one year post-discharge, mortality is no higher. Second, there is a trend increase in readmission rates caused by the elimination of marginal reimbursement. This appears to be due to accounting changes on the part of hospitals, however, rather than true changes in morbidity.},
